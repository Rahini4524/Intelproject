# Vehicle Number Plate and Parking Lot Occupancy Detection
Welcome to the Vehicle Number Plate and Parking Lot Occupancy Detection project documentation. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect vehicle number plates and analyze parking lot occupancy using image inputs. The application is built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the detection models.

## Introduction

**This project serves two main purposes:**

1.**Vehicle Number Plate Detection:**This feature allows users to upload images of vehicles and extract the number plate information from them.

2.**Parking Lot Occupancy Detection:**Users can also upload images of parking lots to determine which spaces are occupied and which are available. Please note that the current model is specifically trained for a particular parking space, but it can be adapted for other environments with additional training data.

The application is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the detection models.
